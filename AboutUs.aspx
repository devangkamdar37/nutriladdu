                    <p class="entity-text">Hi, I’m Anjali Nimbalkar. I believe in a simple principle that nourishment of the body forms the foundation for nourishment of the mind and emotions. I have inherited this principle from my mom. True to this principle, she always used to make delicious and healthy snacks for us. One of my favorite snacks she made was these special delicious Laddus called Gond Laddu. I didn’t care much about it’s health benefits at the time but I just loved these Laddus for their amazing taste.</p>
                    <p class="entity-text">When it came time to pack snacks for my daughter Pari, I resorted to this tried-and-tested centuries old Indian recipe to give her the best nutritious snacks.</p>

                    <p class="entity-subtext">How are we the best?</p>--%>
                    <p class="entity-text">When Pari shared the Laddus with her friends they became popular with her friends as well. That’s when I decided to take the next step to bring my food business idea to life. That's when "Nutri Laddu" was born. "Nutri Laddu" is a modern twist on my mom’s authentic Gond Laddu recipe. These mouth-watering nutrient-dense energy balls are now made with rich and delicious flavors.</p>
                    <p class="entity-text">We welcome you to try these healthy energy ball snacks. Our energy balls are packaged in pairs in a single serve pouch so they stay fresh and you can snack conveniently. Welcome to Nutri Laddu, it’s time to indulge and feel great!</p>
